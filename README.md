# Cancer-Classification-IH2021
"Fleshed Out"
Multiclass Classification on Different Skin Cancers

Note from Vincent: 
- The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/isic-2019).
- The saved model is not stored in this Github but rather on a local machine.
- I've mounted my gdrive in Google Colab and stored the model in gdrive so that I can run the streamlit app script with the loaded model there.
- While the training cancer_classification_ih2021.ipynb was ran within a kaggle notebook environment, streamlit_app.ipynb was ran within Google Colab.
